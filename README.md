# Calorie Tracker

**Calorie Tracker** is a SwiftUI-based iOS app designed to help users monitor their daily calorie intake, calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and track their progress towards their fitness goals. The app provides users with personalized recommendations based on their weight, height, age, activity level, and fitness goals.

## Features

- **Calculate BMR**: Utilizes the Harris benedict's equation to calculate the user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which represents the number of calories the body needs at rest to maintain vital functions.
- **Track Personal Information**: Allows users to input their personal information, including weight, height, age, gender, and activity level.
- **Set Fitness Goals**: Users can set their fitness goals, such as losing weight, maintaining weight, or gaining weight, and receive personalized recommendations based on their selected goal.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilizes a modern and intuitive user interface with SwiftUI components, including segmented pickers, buttons, and interactive graphs.
- **Data Persistence**: Implements data persistence using SwiftUI's `@StateObject` and `@Published` properties to save and retrieve user data across app sessions.
